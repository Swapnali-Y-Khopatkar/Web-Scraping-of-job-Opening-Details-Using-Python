Introduction:
 Web scraping is a technique to fetch data from
websites. While surfing on the web, many websites don’t
allow the user to save data for personal use.
 Web scraping can help companies gather the correct contact
information from their target market—including names, job
titles, email addresses, and cellphone numbers. Then, they can
reach out to these contacts and generate more leads and sales
for their business.
 In this Project we are gathering the job opening details on the
Freshersworld.com.
